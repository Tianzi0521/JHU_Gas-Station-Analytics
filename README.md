Problem Description:
A gas station purchases fuel in bulk (thousands of liters) and sells it to customers like you and me. A
typical gas station (location) may offer different types of fuel (regular gas, premium gas, diesel) and each
type of gas may be stored in one or more than one tanks in that particular gas station. These tanks are
usually underground, out of safety and limited space considerations. The number of tanks and capacity
of each tank is driven by many factors such as available space, city regulations, closeness to the
suppliersâ€™ reservoirs, and demand, among other factors. It is common for a gas station to carry tens of
thousands of liters of fuel at any time. At this relatively large scale, the following decisions may have
significant consequences on the survival and profitability of the gas station:
- Fuel replenishment frequency
- Fuel replenishment quantity

On the one hand, frequent replenishment in small quantities is attractive as it has less cash tied up to the
fuel inventory. On the other hand, larger and less frequent deliveries may qualify the gas station for the
quantity discount at every fuel replenishment offered by its supplier(s).
Independent of the fuel type, the supplier offers the following quantity discounts:

Based on the data provided, we conducted the following analysis:
Fuel consumption patterns of different gas stations,
Fuel purchasing behaviors of different gas stations, and
Relationships or joint movements between consumption and purchasing.
